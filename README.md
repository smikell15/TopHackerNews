# TopHackerNews
Hacker News Visualization App

This application pulls the current 200 "best" stories from https://github.com/HackerNews/API and returns them as a searchable grid.
Tests appear in two spots... server unit tests appear in an independent project, while react tests (for convenience) sit next to the associated component files.
